**Order Reports**

**1\. Simple Report: Order Volume and Geographic Distribution**

• **_Insights_:** The platform has processed a total of **96,211 orders**. Geographic data reveals a heavy concentration in specific regions, with **Sao Paulo (SP)** accounting for **37.54%** of revenue, followed by Rio de Janeiro (RJ) at 13.57% and Minas Gerais (MG) at 11.53%.

• **_Recommendation_:** Marketing efforts and warehouse placements should be **prioritised in the SP-RJ-MG corridor** to maintain dominant market share while investigating underrepresented states for growth opportunities.

**2\. Simple Report: Temporal Order Patterns**

• **_Insights_:** Order volume peaks during the middle of the day, specifically between **10:00 AM and 4:00 PM**. Weekly trends show that **Monday and Tuesday** are the highest volume days, with a steady decline towards the weekend.

• **_Recommendation_:** Schedule **customer support and logistics staff peaks** during the early-week midday hours to ensure rapid order processing and response times.

**3\. Complex Report: Black Friday Operational Resilience**

• **_Insights_:** During Black Friday, daily order volume surges to **1,147**, which is an **8.23x multiple** of normal daily orders. However, this volume spike severely impacts logistics; the **late delivery rate jumps from a normal 3.68% to 16.41%**.

• **_Recommendation_:** Implement **dynamic shipping deadlines** and pre-emptive stock positioning for Black Friday. The platform must scale its courier capacity significantly to prevent the 4x increase in late deliveries seen during peak events.

**4\. Complex Report: Revenue vs Volume Category Segmentation**

• **_Insights_:** With 71 product categories and 32,951 products, Olist uses a segmentation model to categorise performance into **"Grow", "Stars", "Deprioritise", and "Fix"**. "bed_bath_table" is the highest volume category, but revenue distribution shows that categories like "health_beauty" and "watches_gifts" contribute significantly to GMV despite varying volumes.

• **_Recommendation_:** Focus promotional spend on the **"Stars" and "Grow" segments** to maximise ROI. Categories in the **"Fix"** segment should undergo a price distribution audit to see if they are being priced out of the market.

**Customer Review Reports**

**1\. Simple Report: Delivery Impact on Satisfaction**

• **_Insights_:** There is a direct causal link between logistics and sentiment. **On-time or early deliveries** yield an average review score of **4.23**, whereas **late deliveries** cause the score to plummet to **2.26**.

• **_Recommendation_:** To maintain a high platform rating, Olist should implement a **"Late Delivery Warning" system** that proactively notifies customers of delays before they leave a negative review.

**2\. Simple Report: Seller Satisfaction Distribution**

• **_Insights_:** Out of 2,970 sellers, only **552 (approx. 18.6%)** are classified as "5-star sellers". The top 50 sellers contribute roughly 25.93% of total revenue with an average review score of 4.1.

• **_Recommendation_:** Launch a **"Preferred Seller" badge** for those 552 top-performing sellers to encourage customers to buy from high-satisfaction sources, potentially increasing the platform's overall review average.

**3\. Complex Report: The "Golden Cohort" and Retention**

• **_Insights_:** Retention is currently very low, with **97% of customers being new**. However, the "Golden Cohort"-customers who received their order on time and gave 5 stars-shows a **higher repurchase rate of 3.13%** compared to 2.85% for all others.

• **_Recommendation_:** The platform should focus on **converting 5-star reviewers into loyal customers** through targeted post-purchase loyalty rewards, as they are the most likely group to return.

**4\. Complex Report: Regional Late Delivery and Review Correlation**

• **_Insights_:** Late delivery rates vary significantly by state, with **Alagoas (AL) at 20.88%** and Maranhão (MA) at 17.89%, while Amazonas (AM) is as low as 3.05%. These regional delivery failures directly depress the review scores in those specific geographic zones.

• **_Recommendation_:** Conduct a **carrier performance audit in the Northeast region (AL, MA, CE)**. High late rates in these states are damaging the platform's reputation; switching to local last-mile providers in these high-risk areas is essential.

**Analogy:** Managing these reports is like **running a professional kitchen**. The **Simple Reports** are like checking the temperature and the clock-they tell you if the food is ready and how many people are waiting. The **Complex Reports** are like analyzing why the steak was sent back; they look at the relationship between the supplier (seller), the waiter (delivery), and the diner's mood (review score) to ensure they don't just eat once, but become regulars.
